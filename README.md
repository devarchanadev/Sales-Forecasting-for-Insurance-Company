### 🤖 Why These Models?
| Model Type                  | Purpose                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**        | Provides a baseline understanding of how each variable contributes to the likelihood of purchase. |
| **Forward/Backward Selection** | Identifies the most significant variables, balancing model complexity and interpretability.      |
| **Ridge and Lasso Regression** | Handles multicollinearity and enhances model accuracy by regularizing coefficients.             |
| **Logistic Regression**      | Suitable for binary classification, providing insights into the probability of purchase.        |

### 🔍 Insights
- **Significant Variables**: Variables with lower p-values and positive coefficients are strong predictors of purchase likelihood.
- **Past Purchase Influence**: Customers who have previously purchased caravan insurance are more likely to buy again, a crucial factor for retention strategies.

### 📈 Recommendations
- **Target Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts on customers with positive coefficients in the logistic regression model.
- **Customer Retention**: Develop strategies to retain customers who have previously purchased, as they are more likely to buy again.
